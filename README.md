This project aims at a very simple modelling of natural selection through a simulation of interactions between three types of entities: food, prey, and predators. Each organism (prey or predator) is governed by a gene, represented as a vector of traits that dictate its responses to stimuli (food, prey, or predators) within an observation radius. Organisms reproduce asexually upon meeting energy requirements and die if energy depletes. The simulation integrates spatial dynamics, decision-making, and mutation to model evolutionary processes over time.

Key outputs include the evolution of gene components, observation radii, and population dynamics. Graphical visualizations illustrate how survival pressures shape gene distributions and behavioral traits, providing insight into how selective pressures can bias certain characteristics within a population. This work highlights fundamental principles of evolution in an artificial ecosystem and serves as a foundation for exploring more complex ecological systems and adaptive behaviors.
